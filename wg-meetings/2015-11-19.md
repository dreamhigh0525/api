Attendees
================================================================================

* @pmuellr - Patrick Mueller (NodeSource)
* @mhdawson - Michael Dawson (IBM)
* @orangemocha - Alexis Campailla (Microsoft)
* @obastemur - Oguz Bastemur (JxCore)
* @Qard - Stephen Belanger (AppNeta)
* @stefanmb - Stefan Budeanu (IBM)
* @trevnorris - Trevor Norris (NodeSource)
* @robpaveza - Rob Paveza (Microsoft)


Agenda
================================================================================

* Oguz B - I hope the second meeting focuses on public API more. It would not
  make API work separating from node.js entirely.

* Oguz B - AFAIK, JXcore's public API is the only proven approach available ATM
  and it works. IMHO a public API work shouldn't take much time. Cons/Pros etc. discuss and decide ? (Attention: node-ch and JXcore macro are private API!)

* https://github.com/nodejs/api/issues/10 - Native modules API:
  the FFI approach - Alexis C

* next steps - stand-alone chunks to iterate on - what are they?
  * datatypes? https://github.com/nodejs/api/blob/master/native/data_types.md
  * prototype building API on lower-level API (js || native)?


Minutes
================================================================================


Public and Private APIs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[YouTube 3:56](https://youtu.be/3rszjGYpbyM?t=236)

Oguz:

General priorities:  

1. private - reduce amount of work between native bits using shims
2. public - native add-ons; nan as an example

Public API could have it's own types

Patrick: we need some concrete issues

Michael: What APIs are we talking about - the API we provide to modules?

Oguz: yes

Michael: need a full definition

Patrick: different forms of "definition"; C code, documentation, API
modelling languages, ...

Michael: Oguz's current one is in C?

Oguz: current JxCore API isn't appropriate for public API

Rob: current API is V8; we should audit common modules to figure out what APIs
we need

Trevor: still limitations; special VM APIs like GC notification

Patrick: maybe 80/20 is good enough for now

Trevor: how would this be "blessed", and if it has a performance impact, will
never be blessed

Rob: should AIM to be macros and templates aimed at V8, so no performance impact;
other impls might need to add C code

Patrick: let's create an issue for this

Oguz: 60% of this will be easy

Trevor: this approach is the most complicated way to get anything done; need to
also get the all the existing modules converted

Rob: no existing modules are going to work with a new API anyway

Trevor: it's getting complicated; now we need to support multiple APIs

Oguz: SQLite is probably a good example of types of APIs external modules need

Patrick: we need an issue

Trevor: does other native headers (Chakra) exist in V8?  Do we ship multiple
versions of node?

Rob: no other native headers; runtimes act like drivers

Patrick: we need an issue

Rob: I volunteer *[pjm: not his exact words :-) ]*

Trevor: more actionable if consolidate we node header into a single header;
one official header; also create a user-facing shim for V8, not specifically
targeted for abstraction, just to get started

Patrick: what does the user-facing library look like?

Trevor/Michael/Rob: like nan, more API and ABI stable than nan, but can never be
100% API and especially ABI stable, and can be included in node core.  For
native module authors.  Eventually use that API to abstract over multiple JS
implementations.

Patrick: I think we're talking about two main issues: abstracting JS engines and
API for module authors.  Same problem space, attacking from different ends.
Let's get some issues created.


FFI
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[YouTube 38:44](https://youtu.be/3rszjGYpbyM?t=2324)

Alexis - FFI is invoking C functions from JS, most native modules could use
this to do their work.  Some issues have come up regarding performance issues,
but there are some approaches which minimize impact on performance, such as
using templates and having a compiler provide some glue, as suggested at
https://github.com/nodejs/nan/issues/349#issuecomment-110569177

Patrick - there are some issues in node regarding getting Nate's FFI code into
core.

Trevor - PR for FFI was already rejected as it touched too many internal things;
also it needs to be a separate module so that it can be removed by someone who
doesn't want it on their system (for security/safety reasons).

Michael - what does FFI solve

Rob/Alexis/Michael - Also need to handle calling from native code back into
JavaScript.

Trevor/Patrick - Buffers as os memory; adds methods to Buffers; implies constraint
that Buffers are allocated in memory and never moved; perhaps we need
a separate thing from Buffer.


wrap-up
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[YouTube 52:09](https://youtu.be/3rszjGYpbyM?t=3129)

Patrick:

* create some minutes, issues to focus on particular subjects

  * JS engine abstraction API
  * native module API for non-core modules
  * moving FFI forward

* next meeting? In January?  No nays.

* create issue/doodle/gdoc for next meeting in a new issue
